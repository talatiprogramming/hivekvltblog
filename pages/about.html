                    A few years ago, in the depths of my depression, I discovered extreme metal and have been hooked ever since. I am an enthusiast for all underground music that sits at the extremes of art, constantly pushing boundaries and the definition of music. I set up this blog to share my love for a music that isn’t afraid to highlight the darker aspects of the world, even if it can be a bit camp at time. This music has helped me through some of my darkest days and I hope through this blog, I can bring some joy to others going through the same.<br><br>
                    It is also worth mentioning that I am an avid socialist and believe strongly that art is just another medium for politics. Especially when you are delving into extreme genres of music, politics becomes a major issue, as the cult of the far-right tries to recruit more of the alienated into their ranks. Music has had a long history of being a form of protest and it’s time the scene is taken back by those who wish to hijack it and use it as a vehicle to spread their poison. As such, this blog is also another way to cultivate a resistance against the rise of the far-right within subcultures.<br><br>
                    Whether you’re here for the politics or the music (or both) I hope you enjoy the content and be sure to share my posts. Not for my sake but for the artists who put so much passion into their work and deserve to be recognised.<br><br>
                    Many OUGHs comrades.
