            Black metal - if you know anything about it, the words probably conjures up images of long-haired, moody teenagers trying to look menacing in black and white make-up, gloomy scenes of the snowy Norwegian wilderness and church burnings. Despite the misanthropy and far-right nationalism that black metal is known for, it has been growing a left-wing scene too. The raw sound coupled with hateful lyrics and a general sense of rebellion against society lends itself well to anti-capitalist politics, and has definitely inspired many a punk to try out some tremolo riffs.<br><br>
            In this article, we’re going to give you a rundown of the various leftist and anti-fascist bands throughout black metal’s history.

            Before edgy Norwegian teens were recording black metal in basements, black metal was known for being a more extreme version of thrash metal that went heavy on the occult aesthetics. Known as the first-wave of black metal- bands like Mercyful Fate, Venom and Celtic Frost would go on to inspire a whole wave of underground thrash metal that would be landmarks in black metal’s history.<br><br>
            The Brazil would be one of the countries where thrash would be pushed to it’s extremes creating a distinct style of metal that was a cross between thrash, death and black metal. This scene would run parallel with Norway’s scene but would never get the same amount of fame. However, while the members of Mayhem were stabbing each other and espousing Nazi ideology, bands like Sarcofago, Mystifier, Holocausto and Chakal were posing with hammer and sickle flags and taking an anti-racist stance. To this day, Mystifier has been a force fighting back against racism within the metal scene whilst making some of the most iconic black/death metal out there.<br><br>
            <b>What to listen to:</b>  Mystifier - Goetia, Sarcofago - INRI, Chakal - Abominable Anno Domini

            <h3 class="article-subheader">Atmospheric Black Metal</h3>
            <p class="article-text">
            Add a ton of distortion and reverb to your tremolo riffs, throw in some folk influences and maybe some synths if you’re feeling frisky and you’ve got yourself some atmospheric black metal. Ditching the speed and aggressiveness of more traditional forms of metal, atmospheric black metal focuses on creating a dreamy, foggy atmosphere that brings pictures of untouched wilderness and snowy mountainsides to mind. One of the more popular subgenres of black metal, atmospheric black metal has cultivated a fair left-wing scene. Of particular note are the atmospheric black metal titans, Summoning, Panopticon and Wolves in the Throne room.<br><br>
            Coming from Austria, Summoning would now only create quality, raw black metal in it’s own right but would also emphasise the use of synths later on - inspiring black metal’s cousin genre, Dungeon Synth. Beloved for the Middle-Earth themes in their music, they have also taken an ardent anti-Nazi stance throughout their career.<br><br>
            Across the pond in Kentucky, Panopticon combine black metal with southern folk and bluegrass. Their lyrics pay homage to the old, radical working-class history of the states. Their music is a staple for any list of folk/black metal.<br><br>
            Along with Panopticon, Wolves in the Throne Room have been open about their anarchist politics. Like many bands in the atmospheric black metal genre, their music is about nature and getting in touch with the spiritual side of the wilderness. Dissonant and emotionally impactful, they have always gone against the grain of black metal, creating a more serious, mature style of music in a sea of corpsepaint and Satanism.<br><br>
            <b>What to listen to:</b> Summoning - Lugburz, Summoning - Minas Morgul, Panopticon - Kentucky, Wolves in the Throne Room - Diadem of 12 Stars
